        <h1>Myth: Accessibility is 'blind people'</h1>
        <aside>Published on January 11, 2013 by Dave Rupert – Updated: November 23, 2018</aside>
        <p>Accessibility is often viewed as making your site work on screen readers. In reality, web accessibility is a
            subset of User Experience (UX) focused on making your websites usable by the widest range of people
            possible, including those who have disabilities.</p>

        <h2>Four categories of accessibility</h2>
        <p>

            Accessibility can be broken down into four key categories:
        </p>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#visual">Visual</a></li>
                <li><a href="#auditory">Auditory</a></li>
                <li><a href="#motor">Motor</a> </li>
                <li><a href="#cognitive">Cognitive</a></li>
                <li><a href="#temporary">Temporary</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
        <section id="visual">
            <h3>Visual</h3>
            <p>This can be non-sighted users, users with low-vision, users with obstructed vision, or even simply your
                aging parents.</p>
            <p>Associated conditions</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Myopia</li>
                <li>Colour blindness</li>
                <li>Glaucoma</li>
                <li>Albinism</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="auditory">
            <h3>Auditory</h3>
            <p>The web is a visual medium, but captions and fallbacks for sound-necessary media need to be considered
                for hearing impaired users.</p>

            <p>Associated conditions</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Presbycusis</li>
                <li>Acoustic trauma</li>
                <li>Auditory processing disorder</li>
                <li>Otosclerosis</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Motor</h3>
            <p>People with motor impairments typically use a wide range of assistive technology from specialized
                keyboards, to eye trackers, to using single buttons (a device known as a “switch”) to navigate their
                computers. </p>
            <p>Associated conditions</p>
            <ul>
                <li>RSI</li>
                <li>Cerebral palsy</li>
                <li>Parkinson’s</li>
                <li>Muscular dystrophy</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="cognitive">
            <h3>Cognitive</h3>
            <p>Relates to the ease processing of information.</p>
            <p>Associated conditions</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Down’s syndrome</li>
                <li>Autism</li>
                <li>Global developmental delay</li>
                <li>Dyslexia</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="temporary">
            <h3>Temporary disabilities </h3>
            <p>While each of these disabilities is usually permanent, there are often situations in which even
                fully-abled people are “temporarily disabled”. For instance, an arm or wrist injury may temporarily
                prevent you from being able to use a mouse.</p>
            <blockquote>Robin Christopherson (an accessibility expert who is blind) once spoke about how people that are
                driving but use hands-free sets or have their phone connected to the car radio are temporarily disabled,
                as they use the phone differently to how they normally would.
                Of course, no one should browse websites while they are driving but it is important to understand
                different situations like that, where the user may not have special software installed that a disabled
                user might.
